## Introduction to Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used for predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. It's widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and more. This repository aims to provide a clear and in-depth understanding of linear regression concepts and techniques.

## Getting Started

If you're new to linear regression, start with our beginner-friendly resources:
